## overview
This console application allows users to manage graphs representing cities and distances between them. Users can perform various operations such as adding cities and edges, displaying cities, deleting cities and edges, performing BFS and DFS traversals, finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, and deleting the entire graph.

## Features
- Adding a Graph: Users can add a new graph by specifying whether it's directed or undirected and adding cities and edges accordingly.
- Adding a City: Users can add a new city to the graph.
- Adding an Edge: Users can add a new edge between two cities along with the distance between them.
- Displaying Cities: Users can display all the cities in the graph.
- Deleting a City: Users can delete a city from the graph.
- Deleting All Edges: Users can delete all the edges from the graph.
- Deleting a Specific Edge: Users can delete a specific edge between two cities.
- Performing BFS: Users can perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal starting from a specified city.
- Performing DFS: Users can perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from a specified city.
- Finding Shortest Path (Dijkstra): Users can find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Deleting the Graph: Users can delete the entire graph.
